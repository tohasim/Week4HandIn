          <b>When navigating the application only one element actually changes on your index.html file, which?</b>
          <br />
          The "content" div, as this is the div that holds the DOM content that we change when changing pages
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Explain briefly the concept ES6 Modules (JavaScript Modules) and how it was used in the example?</b>
          <br />
          JavaScript modules is the concept of having multiple JavaScript files with specific purposes, which are then
          controlled and loaded by he main "index.js" file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Why did we have to "load" HTML and JavaScript in different ways?</b>
          <br />
          We had to use async await to load our html, as it has to load all the DOM elements from the different files,
          so it is ready to use when we use our js functions
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Why is the phrase singleton often mentioned in connection with JavaScript Modules?</b>
          <br />
          Because the nature of jsModules means that you create singleton variables when declaring them outside of a
          function, and then exporting them to other js files
